# Expo Push Notifications Demo App

A demo project by [Code with Beto](https://codewithbeto.dev) showcasing how to implement push notifications in an [Expo](https://expo.dev) application.

The icon of this app was generated using [SnapAI](https://codewithbeto.dev/tools/snapAI) — an AI-powered icon generation CLI for React Native & Expo.

## Important Note

Before running this project, make sure to remove the `projectId` from `app.config.ts` file to avoid any conflicts.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

Note: Push notifications have limited functionality in Expo Go.
